Description: This is a mirror of the sourceforge repository containing the SimpleHex executable and some screenshots. The program can open hex files up to 4MB in size, for viewing purposes. 

Simple Hex Viewer for Windows developed in FPC/Lazarus.

Version 1.1 for Windows. Works on Windows 10, probably on 7, 8.1 and 11, but I can't say for sure. I've also included the .zip source code of both versions, and the executable of the 1.0 version.
